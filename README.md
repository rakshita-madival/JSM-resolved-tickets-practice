# JSM Resolved Tickets Practice

This repository showcases hands-on IT support ticket resolution practice using **Jira Service Management (JSM)**.  
It simulates real-world service desk scenarios where tickets were raised, worked on, and resolved.

## 🔧 What I Practiced

- Creating a JSM service project
- Raising IT support tickets (example: password reset, login issues and more)
- Assigning, commenting, and resolving tickets
- Managing queues and SLA tracking
- Communicating professionally with "end users" in the comments

## 📸 Screenshots
All screenshots for each ticket are saved in separate folders for clarity.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Jira Service Management (JSM)** - for ticket simulation
- **Windows 11** - main system
- **Snipping Tool** - to take screenshots
- **GitHub** - to share the practice work

## 🙋‍♀️ Why I Created This

I’m actively learning and preparing for a career in IT Support.  
This repo is my way of showing that I don’t just learn — I **practice*

📌 **Note**: This is a self-initiated learning project to simulate real-world IT support tasks.
